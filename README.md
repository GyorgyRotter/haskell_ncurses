# Haskell ncurses example

In this example program I will show how to use ncurses with Haskell.

I tried to be close to the imperative style to make it easily understandable.

## Youtube

You can find the detailed explanation of the Haskell ncurses program on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N68deF_D4Q)

## Environment

I used a docker machine for development. The dockerfile is available in the repository. 

At the end of the dockerfile file you can find the minimal dependencies to compile and run this example.

## How to build and run

To comlipe, link and run just use

```bash
make
